        <p>Programming is an intriguing sector as it gives us the superpower to regulate computer programs on the go. It
            can be used for ships, traffic control, robotics, self-driving vehicles, smartphone applications, websites,
            and many other things.

            To ensure that you remain up to date on standards and protocols, and even more so in the field of coding, it
            is important to track developments in your field. Programmers of all specialties can easily benefit from
            keeping track of the new developments & following industry-leading blogs and websites.

            These bloggers have made a name for themselves in the programming world by posting important, high-quality
            data and tips for coders. You can learn tricks and shortcuts you would never have dreamed of doing otherwise
            by following programming blogs.
            Whenever a tech-enthusiast thinks of exploring the field of programming, the first major question is about
            the language s/he should learn. There are various functioning programming languages in the world; some of
            the most famous being C++, Java, Python, Ruby etc. Now the question is from where to begin?

            C++ is considered to be a truly good starting point for beginners when it comes to learning a programming
            language. It helps students learn the foundation of computer language and coding.
            Despite the emergence of various programming languages like Java, Python etc., C++ continues to hold a
            significant place in the tech world.

            路 It is one language that familiarizes you with computers and programs like none other. It also helps you
            understand computing structure, architecture and theories.

            路 Almost all other programming languages including Java and Python are built around C++. Thus, learning C++
            acts as a foundation for you to easily dive into learning other programming languages.

            路 Knowledge of C++ sets you apart in the tech world. Various big-wigs like Amazon, Adobe, Facebook etc. need
            C++ developers to work on their programs.

            路 C++ programmers are paid well and their salaries are expected to rise in the coming future with increasing
            dependence on web browsers.

            Having a steep learning curve, C++ is not the easiest language to learn, but it sure is a wonderful start.
            Learning a programming language like C++ requires the right path and efforts. Coding Blocks brings to you
            the most finely designed course for C++ beginners. The C++ training course is designed to provide you with a
            platform from where you can start your journey in the amazing world of programming and software. It guides
            your learning right from the scratch and take you to expert level.
            Today, a large part of our everyday lives revolves around the development of Science and Technology. In this
            world of technological development, Programming or Coding is a key to keep going and growing. Thus, over the
            years, learning of programming languages like C++, Python, Java, Kotlin etc. has seen a tremendous growth.

            The present and the coming age is the age of technology. Technology works on development and the development
            of technology relies on tech-geeks or programmers. Thus, it becomes important to have more creative and
            competent programmers in the world, who have the zest to change the face of science in the coming times.

            Competitive Programming is an area that helps coders/programmers to master the coding skills and use them
            for the larger benefit.

            Competitive Programming refers to various online coding competitions held over distinct open source
            platforms. Coders, from across the world, participate in competitive programming competitions to hone their
            skills and showcase their talents. With a constant rise in the number of participants in these online
            competitions, the contention also continues to rise. Thus, it becomes significant to know and learn the
            right skills to become a successful competitive programmer.
